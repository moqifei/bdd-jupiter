STORY: Returns go back to the stockpile

As a store owner, in order to keep track of stock, I want to add items back to stock when they're returned.

SCENARIO: test
   GIVEN that a customer previously bought a black sweater from me
     AND I have three black sweaters in stock
    WHEN the customer returns the black sweater for a refund
    THEN I should have four black sweaters in stock
     AND nothing
